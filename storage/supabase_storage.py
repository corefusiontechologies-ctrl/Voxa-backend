"""Supabase Storage — the only module in the backend that knows how to talk
to Supabase Storage.

Everything else (routers, services, repositories) treats audio files as
opaque objects with an optional `storage_path`. This module owns the bucket
name, client creation, uploads, deletes, and URL generation, so switching
to a different object store later only requires changing this file.
